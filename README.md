## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to center a div usign display flex and display grid. I also learned how to create the design of the mobile resposive. I learned how to positionate the items and the div that contains information in all the main card usign the properties of margin, margin auto and position relative.

Some code I'm proud of: The responsive design

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .container {
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
        width: 325px;
        height: 780px;
        margin: 80px 22px;
    }
    .
    .
    .
} 
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on future projects in how to manage filter properties, because the color filter who envolve the hero image was not the enough dark like the design. In my solution the filter color was a little more clare. I wess it was like that because I don't use the correct filter properties and I want to learn more about it. In other hand, I want to use the mobile-first workflow in other projects. Finally, I want to learn how to place the footer withour affecting the rest of the page.
